    "In this notebook we are going to deal with data from a well-known residential rental application, Airbnb. Specifically, based on the data for the Athens area for 3 months of 2019 (February, March and April), we are going to answer the following question: \n",
    "* What is the most common type of room_type for our data?\n",
    "* Plot graphs showing the fluctuation of prices for the 3 month period.\n",
    "* What are the top 5 neighborhoods with the most reviews?\n",
    "* What is the neighborhood with most real estate listings?\n",
    "* How many entries are per neighborhood and per month?\n",
    "* Plot the histogram of the neighborhood_group variable.\n",
    "* What is the most common type of room (room_type)?\n",
    "* What is the most common room type (room_type) in each neighborhood (neighborhood_group)?\n",
    "* What is the most expensive room type?"
